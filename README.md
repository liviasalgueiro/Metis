# Metis Projects

Metis is an accredited 12-week immersive Data Science program, covering statistical inference, machine learning, programming, data visualization, communication and project design.

Through the course of the bootcamp I designed, implemented and presented end-to-end machine learning projects demonstrating concepts such as data acquisition, supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, NLP and neural networks.

This repository contains the code for all my projects, including their description and final presentation. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! :) E-mail: liviasalgueiro@hotmail.com
