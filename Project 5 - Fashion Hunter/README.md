# FASHION HUNTER - Where Can I Buy This Outfit?

This was my final and passion project for Metis. 

As a person who loves fashion, I know that inspiration can come from many sources when it comes to finding a good outfit.
Maybe you got inspired by a celebrity in a movie or a TV show you watched, by someone you follow on Instagram or even by someone you saw walking down the street.

Most of the times you can't ask the person where did she/he buy the outfit and even if you can, maybe they bought it a long time ago and the store doesn't sell it anymore or if is a celebrity/influencer outfit, it's probably too expensive...

My idea for this project is to find a way for you to follow this inspirations. 

**What if we can build a tool in which the user can upload a picture of an outfit that he/she really liked and the tool would search through online stores to find similar outfits to recommend?**

This was my approach:

## 1. Data Collection
**For this step, I used the files inside the "scraper" folder**
- Using BeautifulSoup, I scraped 35,000 images from major e-commerce stores (Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's) of clothes within seven categories.
